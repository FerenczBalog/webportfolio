                    <h3>Riding</h3>

                    <p>
                        I have loved bicycles and riding them since I got my first bike. 
                        There was a time when I rode for five hours or more. Slowly, 
                        riding became a part of my life, so much so that I started 
                        collaborating with a food delivery company that works particularly 
                        with riders, with the main objective of creating a better environment. 
                        I'm still working with them, and sometimes I do food deliveries purely 
                        for the pleasure of riding, not just for money.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Photography</h3>

                    <p>
                        In school, I was fascinated by the colors and behavior of light and 
                        shadow. That was one of the reasons why, after finishing high school, 
                        I started studying photography at Sapientia University in Cluj-Napoca. 
                        During that time, I honed my skills in event photography.

                    <h3>Economy</h3>

                    <p>
                        In high school, we had economics lessons that piqued my interest 
                        in understanding how the mechanism works. During those months, I 
                        started putting away money and managing it with more discipline. 
                        Some years later, I also tried trading on the forex market. My 
                        interest in the economy was another reason why I started my subcontract 
                        in 2019. Initially, I started with delivery activities, but after 
                        completing audio training, I added two more activities: studio sound 
                        recording and live audio mixing. I plan to further expand my subcontract in the future.

                    <h3>RiderBox webpage</h3>

                    <p>
                        The RiderBox webpage's role is to facilitate the creation of 
                        a technical dossier for theatre performances. It should contain 
                        sketches of the scenery, lighting, and audio, as well as all 
                        the information about a performance. It will be a personalized 
                        webpage with a login request. When you register a new account, 
                        you can add your content to it. The 'Home' page displays the 
                        list of saved performances, which can also be accessed through 
                        the 'Performances' dropdown button in the header. It is designed 
                        to be used by a single account, and at the 'Add new' option, you 
                        can provide the performance's information separately. <br><br>
                        Currently, it is not available on GitHub.

                    <h3>Web Portfolio with wordpress</h3>

                    <p>
                        I created the same website using three techniques: 
                        1. writing HTML and CSS code; 2. using the Bootstrap 
                        library; and 3. with WordPress. The concept was to gain 
                        skills in multiple techniques. At first, it was frustrating 
                        because I couldn't find what I wanted, but now, I find everything 
                        easier. However, my favorite technique is still writing the code 
                        like in the first version. Over time, I learned the logic of WordPress, 
                        and I realized that understanding the logic of any programming 
                        language is the most important part of learning it. Once you 
                        understand the logic, everything else becomes easier. <br> <br>

                    <h3>Hi, I'm Ferencz!</h3>

                    <p> 
                        According to 16personalities.com, I am an advocate, an INTJ-A/INTJ-F person. 
                        I have a great ability to control stressful situations and locate and resolve 
                        their causes. I am open to new challenges and opportunities, and it's never too 
                        late for me to learn something new and develop all of my skills. <br>
                        I like to write accurate schedules for the future and stick to them. 
                        Time is my best friend, and in most cases, I arrive at a place early 
                        or on time. The same is true for finishing a project. <br>
                        I was born in 1995 in Cluj-Napoca and spent most of my childhood in a village. 
                        I finished a theoretical high school in Gherla with a focus on philology. 
                        In the summer of 2014, I decided to enroll in Sapientia University, 
                        specializing in Cinematography, Photography, and Media. I finished my studies 
                        without a license exam in 2017. During this time, I also started working with 
                        the Puck Puppet Theatre as a sound designer and later as a stage technician. 
                        Between 2018 and 2019, I completed an adult course for Sound Engineering at Sapientia University. <br>
                        In 2020, during the lockdown, I decided to move away from my family. One of the main reasons was to avoid 
                        infecting myself and my family with the virus, and the second reason was to find a place where 
                        I could expand my abilities and try different lifestyles. In the summer of 2019, I started a 
                        subcontract with a food delivery company, and a year later, I added two other activities to 
                        the subcontract. Starting in September 2021, I had a contract with a restaurant where my job 
                        was delivering their goods. <br>
                        Besides learning and working, I have had many hobbies, including ceramics, photography, 
                        cycling, cooking, and coding. At one time, I also played guitar. In my leisure time, I 
                        prefer to watch movies, read books, and plan my next day, week, or year with at least 95% completion. <br>
                        I have been interested in coding and web development since high school, so in the summer of 2020, I signed 
                        up for coding courses on platformait.ro, now teach.bit, an online platform where I learned some new things 
                        in writing HTML, CSS2, and some JS lines. I am committed to continuing to learn in this area.
