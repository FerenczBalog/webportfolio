                    <h3>Cycling</h3>

                    <p>
                        I have loved bicycles and riding them since I got my first bike. 
                        There was a time when I rode for five hours or more. Slowly, 
                        riding became a part of my life, so much so that I started 
                        collaborating with a food delivery company that works particularly 
                        with riders, with the main objective of creating a better environment. 
                        I'm still working with them, and sometimes I do food deliveries purely 
                        for the pleasure of riding, not just for money.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Photography</h3>

                    <p>
                        In school, I was fascinated by the colors and behavior of light and 
                        shadow. That was one of the reasons why, after finishing high school, 
                        I started studying photography at Sapientia University in Cluj-Napoca. 
                        During that time, I honed my skills in event photography.

                    <h3>Economy</h3>

                    <p>
                        In high school, we had economics lessons that piqued my interest 
                        in understanding how the mechanism works. During those months, I 
                        started putting away money and managing it with more discipline. 
                        Some years later, I also tried trading on the forex market. My 
                        interest in the economy was another reason why I started my subcontract 
                        in 2019. Initially, I started with delivery activities, but after 
                        completing audio training, I added two more activities: studio sound 
                        recording and live audio mixing. I plan to further expand my subcontract in the future.

                    <h3>Balanced Life</h3>

                    <p>
                        Because we live in a fast-paced world, I am working on a webpage 
                        that can help everyone manage their life. The first version of the 
                        website contains only a weather function, providing a three-day forecast. 
                        I wrote it using HTML and JS, and styled it with CSS. On the first load, 
                        you can see the weather of Cluj-Napoca, which is set as default. However, 
                        the client has the option to input the name of their preferred city, and 
                        the weather API of the current page will update the weather data accordingly.
                        <br><br>

                    <h3>Web Portfolio with wordpress</h3>

                    <p>
                        I created the same website using three techniques: 
                        1. writing HTML and CSS code; 2. using the Bootstrap 
                        library; and 3. with WordPress. The concept was to gain 
                        skills in multiple techniques. At first, it was frustrating 
                        because I couldn't find what I wanted, but now, I find everything 
                        easier. However, my favorite technique is still writing the code 
                        like in the first version. Over time, I learned the logic of WordPress, 
                        and I realized that understanding the logic of any programming 
                        language is the most important part of learning it. Once you 
                        understand the logic, everything else becomes easier. <br> <br>

                    <h3>Rider Box</h3>

                    <p>
                        The RiderBox webpage's role is to facilitate the creation of 
                        a technical dossier for theatre performances. It should contain 
                        sketches of the scenery, lighting, and audio, as well as all 
                        the information about a performance. It will be a personalized 
                        webpage with a login request. When you register a new account, 
                        you can add your content to it. The 'Home' page displays the 
                        list of saved performances, which can also be accessed through 
                        the 'Performances' dropdown button in the header. It is designed 
                        to be used by a single account, and at the 'Add new' option, you 
                        can provide the performance's information separately. <br><br>

                    <p class="text-indent"> 
                        I've started to develop websites more then six years ago just for passion.
                        All started when I started the college in 2014, and I started to work on my 
                        Photography Director portfolio, first trying CMS pages. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-indent"> 
                        Three years ago I've found an opportunity to learn deeper about <strong>web development</strong>
                        and also to understand how a website works. That's how I started the learning 
                        <strong>at teachbit</strong>. Thanks to them, today I got the skills of creating websites and 
                        webapplications using some main languages and technologies. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-indent"> 
                        In the last six years at my current workplace I gained the <strong>abilities of teamwork</strong>, 
                        which is essential creating theatre shows. Day by day my <strong>communication skills</strong> 
                        grows and arriving, finishing everything at the time made me as <strong>punctual</strong> as I could call myself
                        "the manager of the time". In last years I've set to me strict schuedule, <strong>to organize</strong> my time, I've started 
                        to wake up three hours before arriving to work just to have a light morning, that was the interval I 
                        learned a new skill or I reed a book. <br>
                        I don't see my weaknesses as a bad thing, I categorize them, being new challenges to work on.

                    <p class="text-indent"> 
                        By the last two years I've decided change my current professional life to 
                        something what I really love and I have oppotunities to grow. <br>
                        My main objective for the <strong>next five year</strong> to become a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> and 
                        of course, to become the best version of myself day by day.
