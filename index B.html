                    <h3>Riding</h3>

                    <p>
                        I loved the bicycles and riding them since I got my first bike. 
                        There was time when I was riding five hours or more. Slowly riding 
                        began part of my life so much so that I started to collaborate with
                        a food delivery company who work particularly with riders, having their main
                        objective to create a better environment. <br>
                        I'm still working with them, sometimes I'm doing the food 
                        delivery only for the plessure of riding, not absolutely for money.

                    <h3>Photography</h3>

                    <p>
                        In the school I was fascinated by the colors and the behavior of
                        the light and shadow. That was a reason why after ending the high school
                        I started to study photography at the Univerity Sapientia from Cluj-Napoca.
                        In that time upgraded my skills in event photography.

                    <h3>Economy</h3>

                    <p>
                        At the high school we had Economics lesson, which tingled my interest
                        how is working this mechanism. Until those months I started to
                        put away money and to take care of the money with more discipline. Some 
                        years later I also tried trading on forex. The intrest for the economy 
                        was the other reason why I've started my subcontract in 2019, 
                        first with the activity of delivery than, after finishing an Audio training,
                        I added another two activities, studio sound recording and live audio mixing,
                        and I'm planning to extend my subcontract in the future.

                    <h3>Web Portfolio with wordpress</h3>

                    <p>
                        I’ve made the same website with three techniques: 1. writting the html and css codes; 
                        2. Using the bootstrap library; 3. with wordpress. The concept was, earning skills with more techniques. <br><br>
                        At the first was annoying that I didn’t found what I wanted but now… now I find everything easier, but my 
                        favorite will be writting the code like in the first version.
                        Along time I learned the logic of wordpress, how I observed thats the most important 
                        part of learning a programming language, then everything will be easier with it. <br> <br>

                    <h3>Web Portfolio using html and bootstrap</h3>

                    <p>
                        I’ve made the same website with three techniques: 1. writting the html and css codes; 
                        2. Using the bootstrap library; 3. with wordpress. The concept was, earning skills with more techniques. <br><br>
                        What should I say... In bootstrap I still made changes on the style of the website, I used a carousel on the hero page, 
                        responsive grid on Portfolio and Passions section and cards at Recomandations. I've tried to use those samples from bootstrap
                        which is not strange to me. I mean If can't write something in html I didn't took it from bootstrap. <br>
                        At least was fun using boostrap, just the same as all, it seamed to complicated at the first sight but it doesn't couse a problem for me.              <br>

                    <h3>Hi, I'm Ferencz!</h3>

                    <p> 
                        According to the 16personalities.com I'm an advocate, an INTJ-A/INTJ-F person.
                        I have great ability to controll the stressfull situations and to locate and resolve their couse.
                        I'm open to new challenges and opportunities and there is never to late for me to learn something 
                        new and develop all of my skills.<br>
                        Writting an accurate schedule of the future and stick to them. The time is my best friend, in the 
                        most cases I arrive to a place earlier or exactly, and also thats the situation with finishing a project. <br><br>
                        I was born in 1995 in Cluj-Napoca, living the most of my childhood in a village. I finished a teoretical 
                        highschool in Gherla, being at phiology specialization. In the summer of 2014 I've decided to sign up to
                        the Sapientia Univerity, specialization of Cinematography, Photography and Media, finishing it without 
                        licence exam in 2017, meanwhile I started to work with the Puck Puppet Theatre as sound designer, later 
                        as stage technician. Between 2018-2019 I finished an adult course for Sound Engeneer at Sapientia University.<br>
                        At 2020, during the lockdown I've decide to move alone from my family, one of the main reason being to avoid
                        infecting myself and my family with the virus, and a second reason was to find a place where I can expand my 
                        abilities and try different lifestyles, finally to keep that fits to my most. In 2019's summer I've started 
                        a subcontract with a foddelivery company, and a year later I added two oder ectivities to the subcontract, 
                        from 2021 september I had a contract with a restaurant, where my job was delivering their goods. <br><br>
                        Beside learning and working I had a lot of hobbies, the most iportant of them was ceramics, photography, 
                        riding a bycicle the new ones are cooking and codind... It was also time when I was to playing the guitar.<br>
                        In my leisure I prefer to watch movies, to read books and planning my next day, week or year witch are 
                        completed minimum 95%.<br><br>
                        I was interested in codding, web-developing since the highscool, so in the summer of 2020 I was signed up for
                        codding coures to platformait.ro, now teach.bit online platform where I learned some new stuff in writting html, css2
                        and some js lines, and I'm commited to continue learning deeply that area.
