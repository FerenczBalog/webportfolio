                        <p> 
                            Because we live in a fast-paced world, I am working on a webpage 
                            that can help everyone manage their life. The first version of the 
                            website contains only a weather function, providing a three-day forecast and hourly forecast for the current day 
                            On the first load, you can see the weather of Cluj-Napoca, which is set as default. 
                            However, the client has the option to input the name of their preferred city, and 
                            the weather API of the current page will update the weather data accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Technically, my primary goals were to create a responsive, 
                            user-friendly, and most importantly, well-functioning website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I developed the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the HTML side, I used a simple layout 
                            with varying elements. The clock and weather are located in separate div containers at the top of 
                            the page. At the bottom of the page, there is a navigation section with a fixed position, containing 
                            the pages that are ready, and a button that opens a modal with a form. The form allows users to input a new city. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regarding the CSS, I primarily used the flexbox layout model, and for the weather section, 
                            I employed the grid layout with the "grid-template-layout: 1fr, 1fr, 1fr" option, allowing 
                            me to show three equal boxes on screens with a width of 1920 - 901 pixels. For screens 
                            below 900 pixels in width, a single box is displayed. <br>
                            To ensure that the website is responsive, I used media queries for three screen sizes: 
                            small screens (max-width: 900px), tablets (max-width: 482px), and smartphones (max-width: 321px).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the real challenges I faced was working with JavaScript, as it was a new language for me to learn. 
                            I used JavaScript to get the current time, display a greeting message on the homepage, manage user input, 
                            and, of course, retrieve and handle API data. Initially, I attempted to use an API that would get the 
                            client's current location. However, I encountered issues with it, as it would sometimes provide incorrect 
                            information on certain networks. As a result, I decided to set a default location and provide the client 
                            with the option to change it by typing their desired location into a form. When coding, I aimed to 
                            use advanced options such as arrow functions and the advanced if statement (condition1 ? value : 
                            condition2 ? value2 : value3).

                            After completing the basics of JavaScript at Teachbit, we worked on a collaborative project. 
                            The objective was to create a portfolio using only HTML and CSS, with a focus on using 
                            JavaScript for the content and Bootstrap for styling, instead of CSS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to learning new concepts in JavaScript, the main objective was to create 
                            a simple web application that retrieves city data from a JSON file, which is connected 
                            to an API server.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, the main components of the website were written using JavaScript and Bootstrap. 
                            However, like any website, it has an index.html file that specifies the main locations of data.
                            The HTML code contains a header that includes three empty boxes: one for the date and clock, 
                            one for the selected city, and a select element without any options. Next to the header element, 
                            we have a segment that includes heading, image, and paragraph elements. Here, we retrieve 
                            data from the weather API.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main styleing tasks were made with bootstrap, we used CSS to modify them where needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main focus of the project was JavaScript. Initially, we used a function to retrieve data from a 
                            JSON file by fetching it. We then added the cities from the JSON as options to our select element 
                            based on their ID and name. After completing this part, we created another function to fetch data 
                            from the server. We processed the response as an array, and then redirected the data to our HTML 
                            file using variables.
