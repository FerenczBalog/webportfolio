										Web Portfolio html

	DESCRIPTION:
	
		That's a simple website portfolio, the concept was to make a portfolio using simple coding expressions. The portfolio was made in three ways, first 
	I wrote it in html, than I used bootstrap instead of css file, finally I made it with wordpress. All three has something new but I've tried to remain at this theme. 
	For exemple that made with the bootstrap framework, has a carousel in the Hero section and cards in Recomandation section (witch right now is not visible on html version),
	The Wordpress version is based on pages and has included my works from audio and photography area. 
		The webpage's style is a one page webpage, using sections which are connected with the navigation via anchors. I'used six photos, five of them made from me, there three 
	backgrounds, a logo, a profil and a blank profilphoto. Most used technologies are the flex-box and the grid layout. For the grid I've made a samples with width of 
	100% 75% 50% 25%, this method helped me to do the website more responsive.

	TECHNOLOGIES: 
		1. HTML
		2. CSS
		3. FLEX-BOX
		4. GRID LAYOUT
		5. RESPONSIVNESS with media-query
